N1572- Services Marketing 
Academic Year 2024 – 2025 
Group Assignment (GWS) 
Instructions 
GOALThe   goal   of   this   coursework   is   assessing   the   performance   of   a   real   service   provider   based   on online   customer   reviews   and   formulating   actionable   managerial   recommendations   for   the   company.You   can   choose   whether   to   analyse a negative/dissatisfactory service performance –   i.e.,   review(s)   that   highlight   the issues the   consumer(s)   experienced   in   the   service   encounter(s) – or a positive/satisfactory service performance – i.e., review(s) that highlight what went well in   the   service   encounter(s).
CONTENT/STRUCTURE 
1. Select the review(s) and identify the issues (or “what went well”) in the service encounter(s).
You are tasked with inferring either the issues (i.e.,   areas requiring   improvement)   if   you decided to analyse a negative/dissatisfactory service performance, or what went well (i.e., aspects that were successful) you decided to analyse or a positive/satisfying performance, by   scrutinising online customer reviews posted on platforms (e.g., Trustpilot, Google Reviews, Booking.com, Yelp.com) regarding (a) previous service encounter(s). This analysis may be based on a single detailed review   or   a   set   of   reviews that   demonstrate   a   consistent pattern. The reviews cannot be older than one year – i.e., they had to be published between   September 2023 and   September 2024.
Some tips: The more detailed the review, the easier it will be for you to understand what the issues are (or what went well). Look for specific examples and recurring themes in the customer feedback. Consider how different elements of the service (e.g., staff,facilities, processes) contribute to the issues (or positive aspects) you identify. Being familiar with the industry or company you choose can also ease the identification and analysis. 
2. Diagnose the problems (“what went well”) in the service encounter(s) 
To diagnose the dissatisfying or satisfying service   encounter you will use:
• Actor-Network Theory (ANT): Describe the human and non-human actors involved in the service encounter that contributed to the (dis)satisfaction and   identify   their   actions.• Gaps Model: Based on the analysis of   the reviews and the ANT   analysis,   identify the gaps in which the service provider underperformed (in case of   a negative/dissatisfying service experience) or excelled (in case of   a positive/dissatisfying   service   experience).
3. Formulate managerial implications 
Discuss the most important actions that the management should take in response to the   analyses you did. That is, how can the service provider   address the   gaps   (in   case   of   a negative/dissatisfying service experience) or keep up with the good quality provided   (in   case of   a positive/satisfying service experience)? You need to provide actionable and clear recommendations. Some tips: Make sure to use and explicitly identify theories and concepts from the class, textbook or other academic sources to support your diagnosis and suggestions.
